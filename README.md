# Minecraft-in-Python
The minecraft I have created in python using ursina engine and by watching clear-code's tutorial at this link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHSRaVeQxIk
I improved it by adding an inventory, some blocks, a world save utility, and by adding a preview of the block you chose in the inventory.

Instructions :
WASD to move
space to jump

E to save world

I to open the inventory
C to close the inventory or click the red button in the inventory
click on a block to chose it

Maj + q to quit
